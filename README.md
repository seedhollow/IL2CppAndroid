# IL2CPP Android Template

This project is based on [LGL Mod Menu](https://github.com/LGLTeam/Android-Mod-Menu/). Since the original project is no longer actively maintained, We have made several modifications, including:

- **UI Changes**: Updated the menu interface.
- **New Modules**: Added additional modules to extend functionality.
- **Obfuscation**:
  - Integrated [BlackObfuscator](https://github.com/CodingGay/BlackObfuscator-ASPlugin) for enhanced code obfuscation.
  - Added [LSParanoid](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSParanoid) to provide string encryption for securing sensitive text data.

> [!NOTE]\
> Starting from version 1.3, `Il2cppResolver` has been replaced with `UnityResolve` to offer more extensive API support and improved functionality.
> 
> New feature suggestions or bugs can be commit as issues.

## Layout Style

Starting from version 1.4, `Il2cppAndroid` now supports two mod menu layouts: the new default layout and the LGL layout. You can switch between them using build flavors: `seedhollow` for the new design and `lglLayout` for the classic LGL style.

Special thanks to **[nik2143](https://github.com/nik2143)** for bringing back the LGL mod menu layout!

## How to use
To enable and display a floating menu in your target app, follow these steps:

#### 1. Request Permission for Floating Menu
To allow your target app to draw a floating menu overlay on top of other apps, add the following permission to your AndroidManifest.xml file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW" />
```

This permission is required for overlaying UI elements, such as a floating menu, across other applications.

#### 2. Register the Service to Show the Menu
To activate the floating menu, declare a service in `AndroidManifest.xml` to your targer app. This service will handle the display and lifecycle of the floating menu:

```xml
<service android:name="com.android.support.Launcher" android:enabled="true" android:exported="true" android:stopWithTask="true" />
```

#### 3. Call the Loader class
To integrate and initialize the floating menu loader, add the following code in the `onCreate` method within `UnityPlayerActivity.smali`. If your target app uses a custom launcher activity, locate it in `AndroidManifest.xml` and insert the code in that activityâ€™s `onCreate` method instead.

```smali
invoke-static {p0}, Lcom/android/support/Loader;->Start(Landroid/content/Context;)V
```

If you prefer not to use `Remap` , simply call this method:
```smali
invoke-static {p0}, Lcom/android/support/Main;->Start(Landroid/content/Context;)V
```

## Customizing Fonts  

You can integrate custom fonts into your project using a `C array`. To generate the required font data, you can use a hexadecimal editor such as [ImHex](https://github.com/WerWolv/ImHex).  

#### 1. Exporting the Font  

To export a font, follow these steps:  

1. Load the `.ttf` font file into ImHex.  
2. Navigate to the **File** tab and select **Export**.  
3. Choose **Text Formatted Bytes** -> **C Array**.  
4. Save the exported data as a `.h` file.  

#### 2. Importing the Font into Your Project  

1. Copy the exported `.h` font file to the `Includes/Fonts/` directory.  
2. Open `Utils.h` located in the `Includes` folder.  
3. Locate the `LoadFontData` method and modify it to use the newly exported font.  

#### Example: Modifying `LoadFontData`  

```cpp
jbyteArray LoadFontData(JNIEnv *env, jclass thiz, jobject ctx) {
    // Create a byte array in Java to hold the font data
    jbyteArray fontData = env->NewByteArray(std::size(font));

    // Populate the byte array with the embedded font data
    env->SetByteArrayRegion(fontData, 0, std::size(font), (jbyte*)font);

    return fontData;  // Return the font data as a byte array
}
```

#### 3. Updating the Font Variable
Replace the `font` variable in the code above with the array from your exported font file. This ensures that the custom font is correctly loaded and utilized in the project.
